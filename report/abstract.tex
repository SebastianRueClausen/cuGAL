\section*{Abstract}
Graph alignment is an NP-hard problem, making good approximations computationally expensive for large graphs. Recent developments indicate that working directly with adjacency matrices yields better results compared to other methods. In this report, we propose \textsc{cuGAL}, an accelerated version of the state-of-the-art algorithm \textsc{Fugal}, utilizing GPU technology. Our modifications enhance the scalability of \textsc{Fugal} while maintaining its high accuracy. We implement \textsc{cuGAL} efficiently using CUDA and extensively benchmark it against \textsc{Fugal}. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and speed for large graph datasets.
